# TODO: Define fitness function
# - Use evaluate_function(coeffs, x_vals) to compute predicted y
# - Compute MSE between predicted y and actual y_vals

# TODO: Run genetic algorithm loop
# - For each generation:
#     - Evaluate fitness for all individuals
#     - Select parents (use Tournament or Roulette)
#     - Apply crossover (one-point, two-point, or uniform)
#     - Apply mutation (swap, scramble, or inversion)
#     - Create new population

# TODO: Track statistics
# - Save best fitness per generation
# - Print/log best individual and its fitness

# TODO: Run experiments with different operator combinations
# - Store results for comparison (e.g., in CSV or in-memory)

# TODO: Plot convergence (fitness over generations)
# - Use matplotlib to show how quickly/slowly the GA converges

# TODO: Save final best solution
# - Print or export best set of coefficients [aâ€“i]
